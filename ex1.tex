\chapter{Exercise 1: "From small beginnings come great things"}

We are going to use the basic repl for now and no need for the fancy IDE or what editor have you. Clojure is a bit weird if you never done any Lisp programming before. In factthe code might look like a blob of stuff to you. Never fear, we will get there together.

Lets start with printing something. Try the code below in your repl. Start by "lein repl" and then type the code one line at a time.

\begin{code}{ex1.clj}
<< d['code/ex1.clj|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

Here is the output you will see.

\begin{code}{ex1.clj}
\begin{Verbatim}
<< d['code/ex1.clj|cljint'] >>
\end{Verbatim}
\end{code}
